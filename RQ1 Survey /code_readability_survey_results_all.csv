The `number.sort()` is sort of ""hidden"" at the beginning, but once I have a doubt of why ""single level loop"" can solve the problem, then I realise there's a hidden ""number.sort()"" up at the beginning. 

Second one looks okay, very clearly that it is using a nested loop method. The code complexity, while bad, is readable.
